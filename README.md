# cart-remake

[Issues related to existing implementation](https://github.com/lakshanx/cart-remake/issues)

### Notes
1. There is no dedicated cart page. We only have the Cart Drawer.
2. Only react component shared outside of the Cart Drawer is `QuantityBox`
3. Some code related to Cart is different on Shopify repo compared to styleguide, probably due to practical reasons of implementation
